    <h3 style="color: red;">I come from a farm town named Malmesbury.
        I enjoy Movies,Series,Books,Anime,Manga and Music. 
        I really enjoy stories with a rich,engrossing and deep background, I can read those for hours. I want to use the knowledge I gained from this course to become a
    Front-End Developer but I will most likey end up becoming a Full Stack Developer. I also like using my voice. I catch myself singing random songs and repeating voice lines from media.
